<h1>🚀 DivinityEconomy 3.4.4 (1.21) 🚀</h1>
<h2>➕ Updates ➕</h2>
<ul>
<li>
    <h4>Improved Potion System</h4>
    <p>In the latest update, the config values relating to <code>POTION_EXTENDED</code> and <code>POTION_UPGRADED</code> have been made obsolete.</p>
    <p>Potions now store all of their information in the <code>POTION_TYPE</code>, changing from <code>POISON</code> to <code>LONG_POISON</code> or <code>STRONG_POISON</code>.</p>
    <p>This required a large internal change and has an automatic migration, this will run on startup to try and introduce all of these new types!</p>
</li>
<li>
    <h4>Improved Hand Value</h4>
    <p>Hand value now shows both the value of the item and the enchants on it!</p>
    <p>This will only show the value of the enchants if there are any present on the item.</p>
